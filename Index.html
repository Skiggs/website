                        The game is built using C++ in Visual Studio 2017 with SFML for rendering</p>

                     <p> The collision detection is handled by three different approaches:-
                     <br> 1. Naïve Technique, where an object checks for collisions with every other object.
                     <br> 2. SpatialHash, which assigns objects to a grid to reduce the number of checks required.
                     <br> 3. Quadtree, which further refines the number of objects to check by dividing the screen into quads.
                     <br> 4. In addition to collision detection, the project also features an entity component system for managing game objects and uses SIMD instructions for optimization.</p>
